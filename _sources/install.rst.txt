Installing via ``pip``
======================

``Inflex`` can be installed via pip. It is recommended to set up a virtualenvironment before installation, although this is not strictly a requirement.

.. code-block::

    pip install inflex

.. note::
    Note that ``inflex`` requires Python 3.6 onwards.
